The late 70's and early 80's were Journey's most successful period, with songs on the charts such as ""Lights,"" ""Any Way You Want It,"" ""Don't Stop Believin,"" ""Who's Cryin' Now,"" ""Be Good to Yourself,"" and the standard for [power ballads], ""Open Arms.""  

In the following years, there was turmoil in the band, from members getting fired and quitting.  The band reunited briefly in the mid-90's and then continued on without Steve Perry.  A new vocalist was found in Steve Augeri, who has an odd resemblance to Steve Perry, in both looks and in singing.  The band continues to make albums and go on tour.

Last year, Journey got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, with many Journey members from the past and from now present.  ""Don't Stop Believin"" was featured in an episode of ""Family Guy.""  It was also made the official Chicago White Sox anthem on their way to the World Series.        "
